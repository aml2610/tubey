# tubey

Node utility that takes in a YouTube playlist id and downloads all the videos
in the playlist as MP3s.

## How to run

- Run an `npm install`
- Update the `properties.json` file so that it reflects your own config
- Note: the folder you select for the music to be saved in must already exist!
- Then simply run `node index.js <playlistId>`

Feel free to contribute via pull requests. As you can see there are no tests so
that could be a start for contributions!
